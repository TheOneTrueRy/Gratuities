# Gratuities

The Gratuities App is all about giving deserving workers their due. 

Ever run into the problem of doing your best but still having to share your tips with co-workers not pulling their weight? Maybe you wanted to reward a specific package delivery person for how considerate they were with your cargo. NOW with our app you can find a business, employee, or independent user and send them a tip or write them a review based on their service.

Gratuities is made for both mobile and desktop, though the on-the-fly nature of the service has this leaning more towards a mobile application.





## Features

- People can create accounts to be able to either receive tips as a service worker or give tips to their favorite service providers..
- Users can add and manage a business page that is a collection of all users that work at that specific business/branch.
- Every user has their own QR Code automatically generated for them to display at their place of business or share to others interested in tipping them.
- You can search by business name or profile name (toggleable) on the home page to find whoever you like.
- Light-Mode/Dark-Mode Toggle
- Notifications on page (until marked as read) for all new tips and reviews you have received.
- Users receive an e-mail notification from our app when they have received a tip, review, or been added to a business's page.
- WebSockets allow users on the site to be notified, in real time, when they have received a tip or review.
- And more! Probably!
